        <p>Hi everyone, I'm York, and I'm 33 years old. I was born in Sullana, Piura, Peru; however, I have lived in Lima for most of my life. I'm a young adult who loves maths and technology. I'm really into figuring out challenging things. I love
            singing, dancing, and serving others. I aim to become a Software Engineer at BYU Provo University. On the other hand, I yearn to have my own eternal family made up of my future wife and children. Finally, I want to emphasize that the reasons for fulfilling my goals are my parents and my future family. I consider BYU Pathway Worldwide a stepping-stone for my future career and job as a Software Engineer. </p>
